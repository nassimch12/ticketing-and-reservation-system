# ticketing-and-reservation-system
a basic system for reserving trips and creating trip specific tickets.

the system is composed of two main parts, creating a ticket and reserving trips.The code should be clear with all the description in it.

the files are fragile in the sense that the format of the data can't be changed for this system to work.The format should be clear by taking a look at the files I added here.

the system displays trips and their info, takes the user's info and uses it with a basic encryption to create a ticket that gets released in a seperate file.

the reserving of the spots and the decrementation of the available places isn't included.
